## Algorithms developed for Mechanical Engineering class 105: Problem Solving in Mechanical Engineering/Numerical Methods from Colorado State University

Each of the folders in this repository contain an algorithm that we made for assignments. 

Homework 9 - False Position    
Homework 15 - LU Factorization    
Homework 21 - Simpson's 1/3 Rule

All algorithms are works in progress. Even though there could already be built in functions in MATLAB that provide the desired answer, the functions assigned in these are in order to increase the fundamental understanding of the process. This process is of both what is happening in the functions developed and of the basis of how to write code.
