As Homework 15 in the course Mech 105, the assignment was to create an algorithm that finds the LU Factorization with partial pivoting of a square matrix.

** Note: This algorithm is still being worked on and does not accurately produce the correct output. **

## Inputs

### A - a square matrix representing the coefficients of the system being solved.

## Outputs:
### 1. L - lower triangular matrix
### 2. U - upper triangular matrix
### 3. P - pivot matrix

## Error Tests

This function tests for things that could create conflict within the program. 
Error messages are displayed if the matrix A is not a square matrix or the number of inputs is more than one.
